    "A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.\n",

    "Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may imagine that `nums[-1]` = `nums[n]` = $-\\infty$. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
